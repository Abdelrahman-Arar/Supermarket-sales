# Problem Statement
In the field of markets, Supermarkets always seek to improve their reputation and operations and attract more customers and profits. But these places face minor problems in matters such as the lack of effective marketing, increasing sales, and gaining customer satisfaction with services. Supermarkets have collected sales data for three months, but they face difficulty in making good use of this data. The goal here is to use this data to understand customer behavior, discover their choice patterns, study what products should be marketed, and manage branches better.
