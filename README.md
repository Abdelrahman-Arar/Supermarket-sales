### Project Overview
This project involved analyzing supermarket sales data to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. I processed the dataset to ensure accuracy and zero null values, and uncovered patterns and relationships within the data. The final analysis focuses on the key issues impacting sales, providing actionable insights for decision making.

### Problem Statement
In the field of markets, Supermarkets always seek to improve their reputation and operations and attract more customers and profits. But these places face minor problems in matters such as the lack of effective marketing, increasing sales, and gaining customer satisfaction with services. Supermarkets have collected sales data for three months, but they face difficulty in making good use of this data. The goal here is to use this data to understand customer behavior, discover their choice patterns, study what products should be marketed, and manage branches better.
